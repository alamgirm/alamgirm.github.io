<p>In 1912, the ship RMS Titanic hit an iceberg on its maiden voyage and sank. Most of its passengers and crew died, though a number of them did survive. This machine learning (ML) project is to explore passenger manifest of Titanic and find any realtion between surving and any attributes of a passenger. A subset of the manifes was provided as training set for which the outcome of survival, i.e, survied or dead is known. The ML model should learn from this set. A test set was then given with passenger of unkown destiny. The ML model should reliably predict what happened to these test cases.</p>

<p>In the passenger manifest a number of features about the passengers are avaible, including name, age, seating class, ticket number, fare paid, port of embarcation etc. Not all passengers have every piece of information, meaning some of the feature values were missing. The objective of this project is to: (i) identify the features that are highly related to the survival outcome (ii) predict the outcome at least with 80%.</p>

<p>The Jypyter notebook code using Python for this project is found <a href="https://github.com/alamgirm/titanic_survival_exploration">here.</a></p>

<p>It was found the most significant feature that determined the survival is gender- more female passengers survived than male passengers. The second most important feature was age: younger passengers had survived more than older ones. The third most significant feature was seating class. Passengers from lower classes didnt quite make it as passengers from upper classes.</p>

<p>These findings actually reflect the facts that women and children were given preference in leaving the ship and boarding on lifeboats. It is also a fact that upper-class passengers who stayed in cabin had easy access to lifeboats whereas lower-deck passengers had to clib up to upper level to access them. More of these historical interesting facts are discussed <a href="https://www.natgeokids.com/nz/discover/history/general-history/would-you-have-survived-the-titanic/"> in Nat Geo website.</a></p>
