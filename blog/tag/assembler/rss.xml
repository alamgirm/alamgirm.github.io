	     <p>Following on the design of a simple microprocessor in the <a href="/blog/design-a-simple-microprocessor.html ">last post</a>, this post talks about writing a simple assembler for that processor. The main aim of attempting to write an assembler is to learn how the assembly to machine code conversion works.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>When writing the assembler, in addition to the instructions offered by the MPU, we can add extra instructions that would map down to the MPU insturctions during assebmling process. For simplicity of programming, I added two instrucions: CMP (meaning complement, functionally same as NOT), and COMP (compare, functionally same as SUB).</p>

<p>We now have a total of 16+2=18 keywords to handle. The Keywords are: <br /></p>

<pre>NOP, STOP, DUMP, LOAD, STOR, XCHG, JMP, JMPE, ADD, 
SUB, INC, DEC, AND, OR, NOT, XOR, CMP, COMP</pre>

<p>And if you look at the opcodes for these instructions <a href="/blog/design-a-simple-microprocessor.html#opcode_mnemonic">mnemonics</a>, the corresponding machine codes should be (in hexadecimal): <br /></p>

<pre>
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 
9, A, B, C, D, E, F, E, 9
</pre>

<h2 id="assembly-process">Assembly process</h2>
<p>The assembling process is essentially reading the assembly language program, and going line by line to find the equivalent machine code. To find the meaning of a line of assembly code, we need to build a parser that could parse all the assembly instructions we would like the assembler to recognize.</p>

<p>A finite automata (also called state machine) is a perfect tool for modeling the parsing process. Given the 18 keywords that we need to detect, the following is an automata that could do that:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/images/2017/17_06_04_keyword_automata.png" alt="Finite Automata" title="Finite automata for parsing keywords." /></p>

<p>How it works is quite easy to understand. Say we have one line of text from a program written in assesbly language. We begin at the round rectangle block <code class="highlighter-rouge">Begin</code> and read the first character of the input text line. We check if it is either A, C, D, I, J, L, N, O, S or X. If the answer is positive, we move to next character, otherwise, the current characte is possibly a white space or a wrong insttuction. If for example, the first character was A, the second character from the input now has to be either D or N. Otherwise we have an invalid input. We keep on doing this until we end up at a hexagone or detect an error.</p>

<p>All the cicles are intermediary states meaning we have not finished parsing yet. When and if we reach the hexagon, we have successfully identifed or better say parsed an instruction. Consider <code class="highlighter-rouge">Begin</code> as the root of a tree and the hexagons as the leaves. Then following any branch and collecting the label letters will give us only the valid instructions. For instance, from top we have: <br /></p>
<pre>
 ADD
 AND
 CMP
 COMP
 DEC
 DUMP
 INC  etc</pre>

<h2 id="additions-to-the-mpu">Additions to the MPU</h2>
<p>Since the first design of the MPU, there have been few slight modifications, in fact additions, to have better programming capability.  The addtions are: having a register I (Index register) that points to the address in data memory where a data would be written to or read from. Another addition is ADD/SUB/AND/OR/XOR/CMP/NOT can now take register argument. Say, <code class="highlighter-rouge">ADD B</code> is now a valid instruction that adds the value of B to  A and stores the result in R. Another addition is made to XCHG that can now take an argument, and based on it, can move values between registers in more flexible ways. For instance, <code class="highlighter-rouge">XCHG $1</code> will cause the value of A to go to I.</p>

<h3 id="example-program">Example Program</h3>
<p>Here is an example program that the assembler can read and convert into machine code:</p>
<pre>
1  LOAD $0   //load 0 to A
2  XCHG $1   // move 255 to I register
3  LOAD $FF
4  XCHG $0   // move 255 to B
5  LOAD $0   // load 0 into A
6  JMPE $    // if A = B = 255 break loop
7  STOR $55  // store $55 to memory location pointed by I register
8  INC  AX    // RX &lt;= A+1
9  XCHG $2   // move back to AX
10 INC  IX    // R = I+1 
11 XCHG $3  // i = i+1
12 JMP  $6
13 DUMP $2
14 STOP
</pre>
<p><em>Note</em>: Anything after // is comment and is meant for programmer, it is ignored by the assembler. The line numbers at the beginning of each line, is also for ease of reading.</p>

<p>Once the assembler is run on this program, it produces the following output:</p>
<pre>
3200
5201
32FF
5200
3200
7207
4255
A300
5202
A303
5203
6206
2202
1000
</pre>

<p>These machine codes are ready to be loaded to the MPU for execution.</p>
